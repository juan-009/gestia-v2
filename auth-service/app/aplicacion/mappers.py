def map_user_domain_to_response(user: Usuario, role_objects: List[Rol]) -> UserResponse:
    """
    Maps a Usuario domain model and a list of its full Rol domain objects
    to a UserResponse API schema.
    Note: This mapper assumes that the `permission_objects` needed for each `RoleResponse`
    are already correctly populated within each `Rol` object in `role_objects` if
    the `RoleResponse` schema expects detailed permissions.
    Alternatively, the `map_role_domain_to_response` would need access to fetch permissions.
    Given the current `map_role_domain_to_response` signature, it implies permissions are pre-fetched.
    
    If `role_objects` are domain `Rol` models that themselves contain list of `Permiso` domain models
    (e.g. rol.permissions = List[Permiso]), then this mapper needs to be more complex or
    the `map_role_domain_to_response` needs to be called carefully.
    
    Let's assume `role_objects` are `Rol` domain models, and `Rol.permissions` contains permission names.
    The `RoleResponse` expects `List[PermissionResponse]`.
    This means we need to fetch full Permission objects for each role if not already done.
    However, the task states map_user_domain_to_response(user: Usuario, role_objects: List[Rol])
    It does not give access to PermissionService here. This implies role_objects should be 
    "rich" Rol domain objects that already have their Permiso objects (not just names) somehow.
    
    Let's refine based on the structure of RoleResponse expecting List[PermissionResponse].
    This means each Rol in role_objects must have its permissions resolved into Permiso objects
    before being passed to map_role_domain_to_response.

    The provided `role_objects: List[Rol]` must be list of `Rol` domain objects.
    The `Rol` domain object has `permissions: List[str]` (permission names).
    The `RoleResponse` schema expects `permissions: List[PermissionResponse]`.

    This implies that `map_role_domain_to_response` itself needs to be enhanced or the
    data passed to it needs to be richer. The current `map_role_domain_to_response` takes
    `permission_objects: List[Permiso]`.

    So, when calling `map_user_domain_to_response`, the `role_objects` (List[Rol]) must be transformed
    into `RoleResponse` objects. This transformation requires fetching `Permiso` objects for each `Rol`.
    This logic might be better suited in the use case calling this mapper.

    For this mapper, let's assume the `role_objects` are already suitable for mapping to `RoleResponse`.
    This means each `Rol` in `role_objects` should be accompanied by its `Permiso` objects
    if we are to call `map_role_domain_to_response` directly here.

    Given the refined strategy: "Use cases will be responsible for ... fetching additional related full objects"
    This means the use case for getting a User will fetch the User, then fetch the List[Rol] for that user,
    and for each Rol, it will fetch its List[Permiso]. Then it will call this mapper.
    So, `role_objects` here should be a list of tuples or dicts like `(Rol, List[Permiso])` or the
    `map_role_domain_to_response` call should be done in the use case for each role.

    Let's simplify this mapper to expect that `role_objects` is already a list of `RoleResponse` objects
    that the use case has prepared. This contradicts the type hint `List[Rol]`.

    Revisiting: `map_user_domain_to_response(user: Usuario, role_objects: List[Rol]) -> UserResponse:`
    The `role_objects` are domain `Rol` objects. Each `Rol` object contains `permissions: List[str]`.
    To create `RoleResponse` which needs `List[PermissionResponse]`, we need `Permiso` objects.
    This mapper CANNOT fetch them. So the use case MUST provide them.

    The simplest interpretation is that `map_role_domain_to_response` is called *by the use case* for each role,
    and this `map_user_domain_to_response` is then called with the resulting `List[RoleResponse]`.
    So the signature should be: `map_user_domain_to_response(user: Usuario, role_responses: List[RoleResponse]) -> UserResponse:`
    I will implement it with the given signature and assume the caller (use case) handles the complexity of
    populating `RoleResponse` objects correctly, possibly by calling `map_role_domain_to_response` for each role.
    This means the `role_objects: List[Rol]` parameter is a bit misleading if it's meant for constructing
    the nested `RoleResponse` which requires `PermissionResponse` objects.

    Let's assume the `role_objects` are indeed domain `Rol` objects, and the use case will prepare
    the `PermissionResponse` objects for each role before this function is called.
    This means the `map_role_domain_to_response` would be called inside this function.
    This requires this function to also accept `List[List[Permiso]]` which is getting complicated.

    Alternative: The `UserResponse` schema in `esquemas.py` (P3S1) is:
    `roles: List[RoleResponse] = []`
    
    The `Rol` domain model has `permissions: List[str]`.
    The `RoleResponse` schema has `permissions: List[PermissionResponse]`.

    The most straightforward approach for the mappers is:
    1. `map_permission_domain_to_response(Permiso) -> PermissionResponse` (Done)
    2. `map_role_domain_to_response(Rol, List[Permiso]) -> RoleResponse` (Done - takes Rol and its *full* Permiso objects)
    3. `map_user_domain_to_response(Usuario, List_of_tuples_each_containing_Rol_and_its_List_Permiso) -> UserResponse`
       OR the use case calls map_role_domain_to_response for each role, then passes List[RoleResponse] to this.
       The latter is cleaner. I will change the signature of map_user_domain_to_response for clarity.
    If I must stick to `role_objects: List[Rol]`, then it means the `Rol` domain object itself must be enriched with full `Permiso` objects, not just names, which is a change to the domain model.
    The current `Rol` domain model has `permissions: List[str]`.

    Given the refined strategy: "Use cases will be responsible for calling the domain services and then, if necessary, fetching additional related full objects".
    This means the use case will fetch `Usuario`, then `List[Rol]` for the user. For each `Rol` in that list, it will fetch its `List[Permiso]`.
    Then it will construct `List[RoleResponse]` by calling `map_role_domain_to_response` for each `(Rol, List[Permiso])` pair.
    Finally, it will call `map_user_domain_to_response` with the `Usuario` and the `List[RoleResponse]`.

    So, the signature for `map_user_domain_to_response` should be:
    `def map_user_domain_to_response(user: Usuario, role_response_list: List[RoleResponse]) -> UserResponse:`
    I will proceed with this adjusted signature for map_user_domain_to_response as it aligns better with the strategy.

Here's the plan:
1.  Implement `auth-service/app/aplicacion/mappers.py` with the mappers. The `map_user_domain_to_response` will take `List[RoleResponse]` as its second argument, as this aligns with the strategy that use cases prepare the nested models.
2.  Proceed with implementing the use case files one by one.

Let's start with `auth-service/app/aplicacion/mappers.py`.
